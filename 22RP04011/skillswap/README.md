## Scalability, Sustainability, and Security Considerations

- **Scalability:**  
  The app uses Firebase for backend services, allowing it to scale automatically as the user base grows. The architecture supports adding new features and handling increased traffic with minimal changes.

- **Sustainability:**  
  The codebase follows best practices for maintainability, with modular services and clear documentation. The freemium model ensures ongoing revenue to support future development.

- **Security:**  
  User data is protected using Firebase Authentication and Firestore security rules. Sensitive information is never stored in plain text, and all communications are encrypted. Regular updates and dependency checks are performed to address vulnerabilities.
