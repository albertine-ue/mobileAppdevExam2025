## 📱 App Description

**AquaTrack** is a mobile application developed to help individuals and households track and reduce their daily water usage. The goal is to promote water conservation, reduce utility bills, and raise awareness about sustainable water habits through a user-friendly and feature-rich interface.

## 🌍 The Problem It Solves

Water scarcity is a growing global issue. Many individuals use more water than necessary due to a lack of awareness and tracking tools. AquaTrack helps users become more conscious of their consumption by:
- Monitoring daily water-related activities.
- Offering personalized tips for saving water.
- Sending alerts for unusual water usage that may signal leaks.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- Environmentally conscious users.
- Households seeking to reduce water bills.
- Communities in water-scarce regions.
- Users with or without smart meters.

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

AquaTrack uses **AdMob ad integration** as its primary monetization strategy. Ads are placed strategically to:
- Maintain a clean user experience.
- Display banner ads on the dashboard screen.
- Show interstitial ads after logging water usage or viewing progress reports.

This method was chosen because:
- The app is free, increasing accessibility.
- Non-intrusive ads help generate revenue without charging users.
- Ad targeting ensures relevant and potentially helpful ads for users.

## 📊 Analytics & Tracking

To understand user behavior and improve the app:
- **Firebase Analytics** is integrated to track:
  - Time spent in app.
  - Most used features (e.g., water logging, viewing tips).
  - Ad interactions and impressions.

Insights from analytics help refine UX and optimize ad performance.
