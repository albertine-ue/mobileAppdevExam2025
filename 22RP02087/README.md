##  Analytics & Tracking

> **Note:**
> Firebase Analytics integration is currently **disabled** in this project to ensure maximum stability and avoid build/runtime issues during development and testing.
> 
> **Why?**
> During development, some analytics-related dependencies and code caused build errors and blank screens, especially on web. To ensure the app runs smoothly for demonstration and assessment, all analytics code was temporarily removed.
>
> **Planned:**
> Once the app is fully stable and ready for production, Firebase Analytics will be re-enabled to track user behavior, feature usage, and revenue. This will help improve the app based on real user data and support future growth.

### How Analytics Would Be Used
- Track user sign-ups, logins, and feature usage.
- Monitor premium upgrades and simulated payments.
- Analyze user engagement and retention.
- Collect anonymized data to improve usability and performance.

### How to Enable Analytics (Future Steps)
1. Add `firebase_analytics` to `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Restore analytics event logging code in the app.
3. Test thoroughly to ensure no build/runtime issues.
