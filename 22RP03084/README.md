## Problem Statement & Market Fit

**Problem:**
Traditional job-hunting platforms are **complex, slow, and not user-friendly**, especially for young job seekers. These platforms are filled with outdated listings, long forms, and limited interaction options.

**Target Audience:**

- **Young professionals** and recent graduates looking for jobs or internships
- **University students** seeking part-time roles or remote internships
