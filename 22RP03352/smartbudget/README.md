# BudgetWise - Smart Budget Management App

**Student Registration Number:** 22RP03352  
**Academic Year:** 2024-2025  
**Module:** Mobile Application Development (ITLMA701)  
**Developer:** Sandrine Irah

## 📱 App Overview

BudgetWise is a budget management mobile application built with Flutter that helps users track their expenses, manage budgets by category, and visualize their spending with comprehensive analytics and progress indicators.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**The Problem:** Many people struggle with managing their personal finances due to:
- Lack of awareness about spending patterns
- Difficulty tracking expenses across multiple categories
- No clear visualization of budget vs. actual spending

**Our Solution:** BudgetWise provides an intuitive, user-friendly platform that:
- Simplifies expense tracking and categorization
- Provides real-time budget monitoring with visual progress indicators
- Offers comprehensive analytics with charts, trends, and insights for premium users

## 👥 Target Audience

- Young professionals and students managing personal budgets
- Anyone who wants a simple, mobile-first budgeting tool

## 🏆 Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

- **Category-Based Budgeting:** Easy-to-use interface for setting and tracking budgets by category
- **Visual Progress:** Progress bars and circular indicators for budget utilization
- **Firebase-Powered:** Secure, scalable cloud-based data storage
- **Gamification:** Monthly badges and confetti for first expense and first budget each month
- **Advanced Analytics:** Comprehensive charts, trends, and insights for premium users

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

BudgetWise uses a **freemium monetization strategy**:

- **Free users:**
  - Access all core budgeting and expense features
  - See banner ads (Google AdMob) in the app
- **Premium (Simulated Payment):**
  - Removes ads
  - Unlocks access to comprehensive Analytics and Enhanced Analytics screens
  - Access to advanced analytics, charts, trends, and insights
  - Data export functionality (CSV, TXT formats)
  - **Upgrade is done through a realistic payment simulation (no real money is collected)**

### **Commission-Based Monetization (Affiliate Link)**
- The app includes a commission-based monetization feature via an affiliate link (Amazon).
- When users click the "Shop on Amazon (Affiliate)" button, they are redirected to Amazon using a referral link.
- Each click is tracked using Firebase Analytics (`ad_interaction` event with `adType: 'affiliate'`).
- In a real deployment, this would use a valid affiliate ID to earn commissions on qualifying purchases. For this assessment, the affiliate link is a placeholder and no real commissions are earned.

> **Note:** Payment/subscription logic is **simulated only**. The "Go Premium" button launches a realistic payment flow, but no real money is collected. All payment screens, validation, and history are for demonstration purposes only.
> 
> **Why No Real Income Collection:** This is a student project focused on demonstrating technical skills and monetization concepts. Real payment processing, affiliate accounts, and ad revenue require business registration, compliance, and published app status - the app has not been published yet.
