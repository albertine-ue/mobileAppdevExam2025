1. APP NAME & BRIEF DESCRIPTION

RentMate is a mobile application designed to streamline student housing management. It connects students seeking accommodation with landlords offering properties, providing a secure, user-friendly, and locally relevant platform. The app features role-based dashboards, secure authentication, mobile money payments, premium features for landlords, and a modern, animated UI.

.

2. THE PROBLEM RENTMATE SOLVES

Finding safe, affordable, and convenient student accommodation is a challenge for many students, while landlords struggle to manage listings, bookings, and payments efficiently. Existing solutions are often generic, lack local payment options, and do not address the unique needs of students and landlords in emerging markets.



3. TARGET AUDIENCE

Primary: University and college students seeking off-campus housing.
Secondary: Landlords and property managers offering student accommodation.


4. MARKET RESEARCH & UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION (USP)

Existing Solutions
Generic rental apps (e.g., Airbnb, local classifieds)
University notice boards and social media groups

RentMateâ€™s USP
Student-focused: Tailored for student needs (affordability, proximity, safety).
Local Payment Integration: Supports MTN and Airtel mobile money.
Role-based Experience: Separate dashboards and features for students and landlords.
Premium Landlord Features: Monetization via premium listings and analytics.
Modern, Intuitive UI: Fast, accessible, and mobile-first design.



5. MONETIZATION STRATEGY

Model: Freemium + In-App Purchases  
Free for students: Browsing, searching, and booking are free.
Landlord Premium Upgrade: Landlords can upgrade to premium (via mobile money) to unlock featured listings, advanced analytics, and priority support.

Justification:  
Landlords are incentivized to pay for increased visibility and management tools, while students benefit from a free, high-quality service. This aligns with local market realities and maximizes adoption.



6. KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

Animated Splash Screen: Modern, branded entry with animated logo, particles, shimmer effect, and a centered "Get Started" button.
Role Selection: Users choose to continue as Student or Landlord.
Role-Based Authentication: Separate login flows for students and landlords with email/password validation, loading spinner, and double-tap prevention.
Student Dashboard: Search properties, book accommodation, view booking/payment history, manage profile, access help/support, and notifications.
Landlord Dashboard: Add/manage properties, view bookings, upgrade to premium, access analytics, and manage payments.
Premium Upgrade: Landlords can pay (simulated MTN/Airtel mobile money) to unlock premium features. Includes phone number input, validation (10 digits, starts with "07"), error messages, and confirmation dialogs.
Payment Validation: Professional validation for phone numbers and payment flows, with clear error and success feedback.
Dynamic Analytics: Real-time revenue and booking stats for premium landlords, using actual payment data (PaymentRecord model).
Notifications: In-app notifications for bookings, payments, and updates, with notification icon in the app bar.
Accessibility: Centered content, large tap targets, responsive design, and accessible navigation.
Security: Secure authentication, input validation, simulated secure payment flow, and structure ready for secure API integration.
UI/UX Improvements: Material and InkWell for better tap areas, improved button feedback, and professional validation for all forms.
Dashboard Design: Student and landlord dashboards are structurally similar for consistency but functionally distinct.
Testing: Basic widget test included in /test/widget_test.dart.
