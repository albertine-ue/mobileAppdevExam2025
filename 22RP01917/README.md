## üèÅ How to Run This Project

### 1. **Requirements**
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (3.x recommended)
- A Firebase project (Firestore, Auth, Analytics enabled)
- Internet connection for Firebase features

---

### 2. **Firebase Setup**
This app uses Firebase for authentication, Firestore, and analytics.

- The app is pre-configured for a demo Firebase project.
- If you want to use your own Firebase project:
  1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
  2. Create a new project.
  3. Enable **Firestore Database** and **Authentication (Email/Password)**.
  4. In your project settings, add a new **Web App** and copy the config.
  5. Replace the `FirebaseOptions` in `lib/main.dart` with your config.

---

### 3. **Running the App**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shop_management_app.git
cd shop_management_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

- When prompted, select your device (Windows, Chrome, Edge, Android, etc.).

---

### 4. **Admin Login Credentials**

> **Admin Username:** `billy`  
> **Admin Password:** `1234`

- Use these credentials to log in as an admin and access the admin dashboard.

---

### 5. **User Registration & Login**

- Users can sign up with any email and password.
- After signup, users can log in and access the product catalog, booking, and profile features.

---

### 6. **Firestore Security Rules (Recommended)**
To ensure users can only see their own bookings, use these Firestore rules:

```plaintext
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /bookings/{booking} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userUid;
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /announcements/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /feedback/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 7. **Simulated Features**
- **Payments:** The PayPal payment flow is simulated for demo purposes.
- **AdMob:** The banner is simulated; you can replace it with real AdMob integration if desired.
- **Premium Upgrade:** The premium upgrade is simulated for demo; in production, integrate with real in-app purchase APIs.

---

### 8. **Default Data**
