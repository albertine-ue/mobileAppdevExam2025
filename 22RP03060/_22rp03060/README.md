## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Student Event Management:

1. **Fragmented Communication**: Students rely on multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, email) for event coordination, leading to information silos and missed updates.

2. **Limited Discovery**: Finding relevant events is difficult due to scattered information across various channels and lack of centralized event directories.

3. **Poor Attendance Tracking**: Manual attendance systems are error-prone, time-consuming, and don't provide real-time insights.

4. **Resource Management Issues**: Student organizers struggle with participant limits, venue capacity, and resource allocation without proper tools.
